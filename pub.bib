	abstract = {By modifying the angle of tilt of 2 distinct tool pin shapes, both tapered with and without threaded structures, {TPT} tool pin with threads and {TPNT} tool pin with no threads, the mechanical behaviour and microstructural attributes were examined for the joints of {AZ}91B alloy formed by friction stir welding. Spindle torque and unique forces operating laterally and axially (referred to as \textit{Y}-force and \textit{X}-force, respectively) were created at the junction of the tool and plate, which were monitored and assessed in order to know the influence of degrees of tilt. When the tool\&\#x2019;s angle of tilt advances, torque and forces of the spindle also show an increasing trend that is important to friction stir welding. The spindle torque and \textit{Y}-force produced by the {TPT} tool are higher than those of the {TPNT} tool, whereas the \textit{X}-force associated with the {TPT} tool is less. Discrepancies in forces grow along the concurrent increase in the angle of tilt for the {TPNT} as well as {TPT} tools, exhibiting opposite behaviour. The onion ring-type structure was visualized in the threaded tool pin structure {TPT} due to the high flow of plasticized metal compared to {TPNT} tool joints, for which the onion ring shape is not visible. With the {TPT} tool, the joint made at a 0\&\#xb0; angle of tilt had a peak tensile strength of 232\&\#x2009;{MPa}.},

The matrix and fibre composition are fixed as 80\&\#x2009;:\&\#x2009;20 throughout the study, and the nanosilica is disbanded in diversified volume fractions of 0\&\#x0025;, 0.5\&\#x0025;, 1.0\&\#x0025;, 1.5\&\#x0025;, 2.0\&\#x0025;, and 2.5\&\#x0025;, respectively, while preparing luffa/epoxy/nanosilica ({LES}) composite samples. The mechanical characteristics, such as tensile, flexural, and impact behaviour of the composite, and the thermal properties, namely, thermal stability and thermal conductivity, are examined for the {LES} samples. The experiments are accomplished as per the {ASTM} standards. The results revealed that the assimilation of nanosilica particles in epoxy has improved the mechanical and thermal characteristics of the composite significantly. The tensile, flexural, and impact strength of the composite have been amended by 157.58\&\#x0025;, 66.9\&\#x0025;, and 16.5\&\#x0025; with 1.5\&\#x0025; addition of nanosilica in epoxy. Similarly, thermal conductivity of the composite is improved by 47.53\&\#x0025; with the dispersion of 2.5\&\#x0025; nanosilica in epoxy matrix. In addition, the thermal stability of the {LES} composite samples is substantially improved while disbanding nanosilica in epoxy matrix. However, the better results are reported for the {LES} composites containing 1.5\&\#x0025; nanosilica content, compared to the next higher volume fractions of nanosilica content in epoxy matrix.},

	abstract = {The hypoeutectic aluminum alloy ({AlSi}10Mg) is a well-known candidate material used predominantly for its processability and inherent characteristics in metal-based additive manufacturing. Besides, transition metal carbide, such as niobium carbide ({NbC}), is added to the {AlSi}10Mg, enhancing its mechanical properties and preferably its wear resistance to the matrix. However, in additive manufacturing, the mixed powder\&\#x2019;s flowability is a prerequisite for determining the final properties of the specimens. In this study, mixed powder flowability analysis was carried out through the regular mixing of {AlSi}10Mg with a varying weight percentage of {NbC} conducted in the planetary ball mill with different time, speed, and {NbC} composition following the Central Composite Design ({CCD}), with a total of 20 experiments. Here, regular mixing was preferred to retain the morphology of the {AlSi}10Mg (spherical shape) instead of ball milling, which contributes to the degradation of the powder\&\#x2019;s shape and size. Finally, based on the combined analysis of apparent density ({AD}), tapped density ({TD}), and static angle of repose ({SAoR}), the flowability characteristics of the mixed powders ({AlSi}10Mg\&\#x2009; \&\#x2b;\&\#x2009; X \&\#x0025; {NbC}) were evaluated.

Further, the nano-reinforcements have been acknowledged to be the better solution for enhancing the mechanical characteristics of the natural fiber based polymer composites. In this context, the present work investigates the influence of nanoclay reinforcement in luffa/epoxy ({LE}) polymer composite material at different loading fractions (0\%, 1.0\%, 2.0\%, and 3.0\%). The results revealed that the addition of nanoclay till 2.0\% in {LE} composites had become more beneficial in terms of improvement in mechanical characteristics. However, the addition of nanoclay after 2.0\% had ended-up in adverse effects due to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles. The highest percentage improvement in tensile, compression and flexural properties was observed as 20.0\%, 18.69\%, and 21.44\%, respectively with the addition of 2.0\% of nanoclay in {LE} composites. The percentage of enhancement in tensile, compression and flexural properties was suppressed by 6.44\% 8.5\%, and 8.32\%, respectively with the addition of 3.0\% nanoclay comparing to the previous fraction.},

Differential thermal examination of the nanocomposite powders revealed their an Al 6082 matrix with a homogeneous dispersion and scattering. Compressive strength and hardness were analyzed for their mechanical qualities. The Al 6082 – 2.5 wt\% {TiC} nanocomposite sintered at 798 K had a maximum hardness of 1265 {MPA}, which was roughly four times as high as the Al 6082 microcrystalline material's maximum hardness.

There has been research done on the influence of densification on the compaction stiffness, impact strength and Vickers hardness reinforced with carbon nanotube fibres.

This research focused on water absorption and bio composites from the treatment and untreated Pineapple Leaf Fiber in an epoxy resin matrix that will strengthen nano-rice husk particles. The reinforcement and filler material had different weight percentages for the production of hybrid composite specimens, while the epoxy resin matrix was constant. We employed traditional handmade techniques and effectively produced the same process for hybrid composite boards. For water absorption testing hybrid biocomposite specimens were prepared for experimental results in conformity to the {ASTM} standards. Epoxy resin matrix hybrid composite specimens, incorporated reinforced nano-rice husk particles, have been absorbed and are comparable to the water absorption of pineapple fibre. Experimental evidence suggests that pineapple leaf fibre samples treated chemically have a higher water absorption performance than untreated pineapple (24 Wt. per cent), which has high levels of composite husk nano-rice (6 Wt. per cent).},

	abstract = {The recognition of the need for sustainable development has increased over the past few years, which has led to the use of natural fibers as a novel substitute for synthetic fiber with bio-composites. Major work on natural fiber polymeric composites has been conducted in recent years. In terms of mechanical behavior and application efficiency, most of the studies are about the characterization of natural fibers and their contrast with traditional composites. In particular engineering applications, there are several dozen varieties of natural fibers with various properties that affect their use or not. Bio-based material production requires very fascinating cellulose fibers, with their mechanical properties such as lower density, eco-friendly, renewability, and financial viability. Recently, owing to their low density and renewability naturally-fibers polymer composites gained substantial attention for numerous industrial applications. Natural fibers materials of organic composites are derivatives of re-source degradation and can be perceived as having a major economic and environmental advantage. This paper briefly discussed the importance and applications of natural fibers in various areas along with Sustainable Development.},

	abstract = {In most developing worlds, cooking with heat has been a technically feasible replacement for fuelwood in food production as the need of the hour. Cooking energy accounts for 36\% of India's gross primary energy use. Non-commercial oils are used mainly by the rural and urban populations to fulfil their energy requirements. Solar cooking is one potential alternative, but it has been met with some resistance due to some obstacles. Simple box-type solar cookers are an easy way to cook food utilizing solar energy throughout the day, but cooking is not feasible all across the night-time. In this research, a box-type solar cooker with energy storage is developed, and a performance study is conducted to enable food to be cooked at odd hours. Thermal energy has been stored using phase change content ({PCM}). The amount of energy retained, the amount of heat lost during the charging and discharging period, and the amount of {PCM} needed are all calculated. Experiments were carried out with two continuous loads in a cooker with a 0.5 m2 aperture region and {PCM} (Erythritol). While the performance of the {PCM} cooker is comparable to that of a simple box-type cooker, cooking during off-sunshine hours is not feasible with the simple box-type cooker, according to the report. However, by utilizing the specially built and manufactured {PCM} cooker, cooking can be done at any time of day. As a result, this paper aims to summarise the research on solar cooking systems that incorporate phase shift materials ({PCMs}).},
